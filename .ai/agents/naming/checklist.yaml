      Java Naming Conventions:
      - Classes and Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., UserService, DataProcessor)
      - Methods and Variables: camelCase (e.g., getUserName, processData)
      - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_COUNT, API_VERSION)
      - Packages: lowercase with dots (e.g., com.example.service)
      - Avoid: Hungarian notation (strName), underscores in methods (get_user), single letters except loop counters

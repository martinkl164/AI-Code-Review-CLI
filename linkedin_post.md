Today I'm sharing a CLI-based AI code review system I built to catch issues before they hit your codebase.

It's a pre-commit hook that reviews Java code using GitHub Copilot and blocks commits on critical issues (security vulnerabilities, SQL injection, hardcoded secrets). Only reviews staged diffs, outputs strict JSON, and works in any terminal or CI pipeline.

And a reminder: not every AI tool needs to be complex—sometimes a well-placed hook with smart prompts is all you need to prevent production incidents.

It's not perfect — but I find it genuinely useful for enforcing code quality at commit time.
